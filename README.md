## Description
A website where you can enter places you've been to create an online travel diary.

A Place should be an object. Begin by giving it the property cityName.

After testing all back-end logic and developing an MVC front-end for this application, expand your Place model to include relevant properties like picture(s), how long you stayed, whom you travelled with, a journal entry, and so on. Integrate these into your front-end MVC application.

At the very least, the front end MVC web application should support RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.

### Steps/Use Case:
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------ | :------------- |
| **Homepage** | User accesses:http://localhost:5000/| User vies:Landing Homepage |
| **User enters in a to do list place | I: Get Gas | None;|
| **User clicks button and to do list place is populated | I: (click button) | O: Place on the list :"Get Gas"|
